Basic SQL Project For Practice

Here are a few basic problems related to employee demographics and salary that can be solved using SQL:

1) Retrieve a list of employees along with their basic information such as name, gender, date of birth, and salary.

2) Calculate the average salary of all employees in the company.

3) Retrieve a list of employees who earn more than $100,000 per year.

4) Retrieve a list of employees who earn less than $50,000 per year and have been with the company for more than 5 years.

5) Calculate the total number of male and female employees in the company.

6) Calculate the average salary of male and female employees separately.

7) Retrieve a list of employees who have joined the company in the last 6 months.

8) Retrieve a list of employees who have a job title of 'Manager' and earn more than $80,000 per year.

9) Calculate the average salary of employees by department.

10) Retrieve a list of employees who have the highest salary in their respective departments.
